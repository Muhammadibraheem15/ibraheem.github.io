### 2.2 Code Overview
The provided Python code utilizes standard libraries (csv, json, xml) for data extraction and manipulation. It employs PonyORM for relational mapping and interacts with a MySQL database hosted on europa.ashley.work.

### 2.3 ETL Process Documentation
The ePortfolio accompanying the code provides a comprehensive documentation of the ETL process. It includes reflections on the approach, challenges faced, strategies employed, and visual aids such as flowcharts and data models.

### 2.4 Workshop Reflections
The ePortfolio integrates reflections from various workshops, establishing connections between theoretical learnings and their practical application in the ETL process. This section showcases how workshop insights informed decision-making in the Python ETL task.

### 2.5 Automation Difficulties and Future Considerations
The final section of the ePortfolio delves into potential difficulties Orchid Tech may face in automating the ETL process fully. It also outlines future considerations aligned with the company's expansion scenario.

## 3. Task 2: Scaling Up: Big Data, Big Problems?
### 3.1 Objective
The second task involves writing an 8-page report evaluating technology solutions for Orchid Tech's international expansion. It critically analyzes the choice of Relational Database and discusses potential Big Data issues, considering regulatory, legal, and technological aspects.

### 3.2 Technology Solutions Evaluation
The report delves into potential technology solutions, including cloud infrastructure, analytics platforms, collaboration tools, and CRM systems. Recommendations are provided with rationales.

### 3.3 Relational Database Critique
A critical evaluation of the chosen MySQL Relational Database is presented. Considerations for scalability and potential challenges are discussed.

### 3.4 Big Data Issues Analysis
The report highlights and discusses Big Data issues related to international expansion, covering regulatory compliance, data security, cultural variances, scalability, and data quality.

## 4. Conclusion
The assignment culminates in a conclusion that synthesizes key findings, recommendations, and insights from both Task 1 and Task 2. It offers a holistic overview of Orchid Tech's data management and expansion journey, emphasizing the synergy between practical implementation and theoretical knowledge.
